Thanks for checking out Asteroid Runner!

For some reason I decided to also make this a NodeJS project. So this has all the code that WebStrom gives you automatically. Until I get ambitious and pull the actual game out and get rid of the Node stuff you'll just have to run the whole thing.

`node bin/www` to run it!

If you wanna check out the code, the JavaScript is in the public folder.
